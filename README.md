## Overview and Origin:
Volopay is a company in Payment/Billing industry of FinTech. Volopay was founded in 2019 by CEO Rajith Shaji and CTO Rajesh Raikwar. 
Founders were working together at a company that provided financial services comparison platform where they experienced difficulty in tracking different company spending activities.
 They thought of a better way to do that and idea to form Volopay was born.As of January 2021 the company raised $2.1MM in seed funding.

Volopay streamlines processing of expenses  incurred by employees of its clients. Company provides corporate cards, credit, money transfers,
 expense reimbursements, and automated accounting—all in one platform. 
Volopay's intended customers are companies in Asia-Pacific Region that have employees whose expenses they reimburse.
 More than a hundred of companies started using Volopay’s product in Singapore since 2019.
According to Finextra website “Volopay offers everything businesses need to operate digitally and accelerate their growth; 
business accounts, corporate cards, money transfers, expense tracking, subscription management and accounting all in one single platform.” 
Company integrated with API technology of Airwallex, another FinTech company, to better serve its customers.

Currently Volopay syncs with Xero, Quickbooks, and Netsuite. I suggest that it adds comre companies to that list. Attractive names would be TurboTax and Mint.
